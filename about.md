<br>
<p>My name is Josh Reiderman and I have a BS in EE. I currently work as an electrical development engineer designing RF coils for MR systems.  This is a personal blog to document some of my hobby projects. Hopefully, this will provide help or inspiration to anyone else who finds their way here. Feel free to contact me with questions using any method listed at the bottom of the page.</p>
